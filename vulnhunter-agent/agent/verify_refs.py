"""Pre-flight extraction of cross-repo references from developer comments.

Cross-repo references in developer comments (URLs, ``../`` paths,
named repo identifiers) point at source code that lives outside the
target checkout. To verify a fix that's spread across two repos, the
verifier needs access to both — so the orchestrator runs this model
pre-flight before invoking the skill, scans every comment for
cross-repo references, resolves each via ``resolve_repo_hint``, and
pre-clones whatever it can.

This is the *only* path the agent uses to acquire additional repos.
The skill used to emit a ``verify_clone_request.json`` stop-signal
when it spotted a cross-repo reference during phase 0, but that
mechanism was retired once the pre-flight existed — the skill now
classifies any unresolved cross-repo reference as
``rejected_unverifiable`` (R2) and continues.

This module calls the selected scan-session model —
the same model the scan stage runs — to extract cross-repo references.
Unlike the issues stage it does NOT use the haiku->sonnet fallback tiers
and does not escalate on failure; a failed pre-flight degrades to
skill-side R2 detection. We feed the model
the assembled per-comment text and ask for a strict-JSON list of
cross-repo references — same shape ``_process_clone_request`` already
consumes. The orchestrator then resolves each (via the existing
``resolve_repo_hint`` + alias logic), clones what it can, and
records the rest as ignored hints — all before the skill is
invoked. The skill sees a fully-resolved checkout on its single
pass; R2 stays in place as a defense-in-depth net for anything
Haiku misses.

The prompt is deliberately narrow: only **unambiguous** cross-repo
references count (explicit URLs, ``../<name>`` paths, quoted "see
the X repo" phrasings with a hyphenated identifier ≥4 chars).
Fuzzy hints ("our shared library", "the framework") are left for
the skill's R2 to decide on. This minimizes false positives without
losing the common case the design was built around.

_EXTRACTOR_SYSTEM = """You extract cross-repository references from a \
developer-comments markdown file into strict JSON. You return ONLY a JSON \
object — no prose, no code fences, no commentary.

CONTEXT: A verifier is about to check whether a security finding was \
correctly fixed. The comments file (below in the user message) contains \
developer prose justifying the fix. If a comment references code that lives \
OUTSIDE the target repository the verifier was given, that external source \
must be cloned before verification can proceed.

YOUR JOB: Identify every UNAMBIGUOUS cross-repository reference in the \
comments. Be conservative — false positives slow the run, but false \
negatives are caught by a downstream safety net.

FLAG these patterns:

1. Explicit git repository URLs:
   - https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>[...]
   - https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>[.git]
   - git@<host>:<owner>/<repo>[.git]
   - ssh://...
2. Relative paths that clearly point outside the target repo:
   - ../<repo-name>/...
   - ../<repo-name> (bare)
3. Named references with a hyphenated or underscore-separated identifier ≥4 \
characters:
   - "see the platform-validators repo"
   - "implemented in our shared-libs project"
   - "in our other repo: foo/bar-service"

DO NOT FLAG:

- Plain file paths inside the current repo (anything without `../` is local).
- Package or library names (e.g. "react", "boto3", "httpx") — those are \
dependencies, not source repositories the verifier needs to read.
- Generic mentions without a specific identifier ("the framework", "our \
microservice", "the upstream service").
- The comments file's own structural markers (`<!-- ... -->` HTML comments).

Schema (always emit `requested_sources` even when empty):

{
  "requested_sources": [
    {
      "claim_excerpt": "verbatim snippet of the comment line, ≤200 chars",
      "repo_hint": "URL or identifier from the patterns above, copied verbatim",
      "reason": "one-sentence reason this source needs to be cloned"
    }
  ]
}

Return {"requested_sources": []} when no qualifying references appear.
Do not deduplicate — each distinct mention is one entry. The downstream \
deduplicates by ``repo_hint``.
