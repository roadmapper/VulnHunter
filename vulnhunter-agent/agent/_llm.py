"""Small JSON-oriented LLM calls for supported model runtimes.

The Anthropic path uses a short-lived ``ClaudeSDKClient`` per call with no
tools. The OpenAI path uses one tool-free Responses request through the same
base URL, API key, model, and reasoning settings as the scan runtime.

Two entry points (both async):
- ``call_json``: one model call with same-model retry on transient
  (HTTP 429 / 5xx / overload) errors; parsed JSON returned.
- ``call_json_with_fallback``: same as ``call_json`` for the primary
  model, then — on any ``LLMError`` (transient retries exhausted, or
  non-transient transport / parse failure) — re-runs with the
  secondary model under the same retry policy.

**Transient-error architecture.** Classification is type-based at the
retry decision point. Detection happens once per call, at the
SDK→``call_json`` boundary:

1. ``_send_prompt`` raises ``TransientLLMError`` directly when a
   ``ResultMessage`` arrives with ``is_error=True`` and a transient
   ``api_error_status`` (429 / 5xx). This is the typed primary path
   — no string matching anywhere.
2. SDK exceptions (``claude_agent_sdk.ProcessError`` etc.) bubble
   into ``call_json``'s exception handler, which calls
   ``_classify_boundary_error``. That walks the exception chain,
   uses typed ``status_code`` / ``response.status_code`` attrs
   first, and only falls back to the shared
   ``_transient`` word-boundary regex for SDKs that surface
   the upstream HTTP code in stderr text alone.

After classification, tenacity's ``retry_if_exception(_is_transient)``
is a pure ``isinstance`` walk of the cause chain — the retry decision
point itself does no string matching.

    backoff wait twice.

    ``stage`` is a short label (e.g. ``"extract"``, ``"dedup"``) included
    in fallback and retry logs so multi-stage runs are distinguishable.

    The "primary failed, retrying with fallback" warning is logged

    failure (transport gave up or JSON was unparseable); we always want
    it surfaced. The same-model transient-retry INFO traces ARE gated on
    ``config.logging.retries`` — those are noisier and lower-signal.
